  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> May 19, 2025</p>
  <p>Smart Hover Reader (“we”, “us”, or “our”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your choices regarding that data.</p>
  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Article URLs:</strong> When you hover over a link, the extension fetches the URL you hovered to retrieve its content for summarization. This URL is temporarily sent to OpenAI’s API and is not stored permanently beyond an in-memory cache during your browsing session.</li>
    <li><strong>Article Text:</strong> The extension extracts the text of the article in order to generate a summary. Extracted text is sent to OpenAI’s servers and cached in-memory (in your browser) for performance, but not saved to disk or sent elsewhere.</li>
    <li><strong>Allowed Sites List:</strong> You can configure which domains Smart Hover Reader runs on. This list of hostnames is stored in your browser’s synchronized storage (chrome.storage.sync) so that it is available across your devices but not shared with any external service.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use the URLs and article text solely to generate AI-powered summaries via OpenAI’s API. We do not use this information for any other purpose, nor do we sell or share it with third parties.</p>
  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Smart Hover Reader uses OpenAI’s API to produce summaries. For details on how OpenAI handles data, please refer to their privacy policy: <a href="https://openai.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://openai.com/privacy</a>.</p>
  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>Article summaries are cached in-memory for up to one hour to improve performance. No data is written to disk or sent to any server other than OpenAI’s API.</p>
  <h2>Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can clear your browser’s cache or disable the extension at any time to remove any in-memory data.</li>
    <li>You can edit or remove the list of allowed sites in the extension settings popup.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:you@example.com">you@example.com</a>.</p>
